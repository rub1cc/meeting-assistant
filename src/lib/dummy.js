Okay, cool, let's try to do English-Italian. Sure, let's do it. Hey, chat GPT, how are you? I'm doing fantastic. Thanks for asking. How about you? How's your day going? I'm doing great. So I would like you to function as a translator. I have a friend here who only speaks Italian, and I only speak English. And every time you hear English, I want you to translate it to Italian. And if you hear Italian, I want you to translate it back to English. Is that good? Perfect. Mike, she wonders if whales could talk, what would they tell us? They might ask, how do we solve linear equations? Potrebbero chiederci, come risolviamo le equazioni lineari? Sicuramente, sì. Certainly, yes. Great, looks like it works.",
